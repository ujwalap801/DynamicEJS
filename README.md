# Dynamic Route Implementation with EJS in Node.js

## Overview

This project serves as a practical demonstration of creating dynamic routes using the Express.js framework along with the EJS templating engine in a Node.js environment.

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how to handle dynamic parameters in routes and dynamically render content using EJS templates based on these parameters. 

- Illustrates the creation of dynamic routes in an Express.js application.
- Demonstrates the use of EJS templates to dynamically render content based on route parameters.
- Provides a simple yet effective example to understand the concepts of dynamic routing and templating.


## Usage

The repository includes a simple Express.js application that demonstrates dynamic routes with EJS. Examine the code, explore the routes, and observe how EJS templates dynamically render content based on the provided parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templating engine for generating HTML markup.
